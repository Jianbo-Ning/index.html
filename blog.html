        <li>What challenges or
        troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
            </li>
            <p>Due to language barriers, I cannot clearly understand the assignment requirements. I
            watched the video of the class repeatedly.</p>
            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
            <p>I learned how to create paragraphs and add pictures, this is what I already know</p>
            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment?
            How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>I think the most useful resource is our class video, which I watched repeatedly.
